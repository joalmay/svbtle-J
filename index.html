<p>Make something people want.
Paul Graham
I’ve made a lot of stuff no one wanted.

Trying to grow my first business, Inkling, I did what good Lean Startup followers would do. I turned some of our technology into a small “project management software” prototype and used Quora and LinkedIn to set up meetings with project managers.

One thing became clear fast. These project managers weren’t impressed. I was often told the prototype would need to do at least everything their current tools and processes already did, before they’d consider using it with their team. They were reluctant to switch.At W3Schools you will find all the Web-building tutorials you need,
from basic HTML and XHTML to advanced XML, XSL, Multimedia and WAP.</p>
